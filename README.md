# YU Kaltura Media Package

"YU Kaltura Media Package" is a third-party's Kaltura plugin package (a series of plugins) for Moodle 2.9 or later.
This package is developed by the Media and Information Technology Center, Yamaguchi University.
By using this package, users can upload media to the Kaltura server, and easily embed the media in Moodle courses.
Moreover, this package provides some useful functions.
Since this package does not require Kaltura Application Framework (KAF), can work with Kaltura Community Edition (CE) and other editions.

In order to use this package, administrators must install "[YU Kaltura Media Local Libraries](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_yukaltura)" and "[YU Kaltura Media Gallery](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_yumymedia)".
These plugins provide functions such as uploading, playing back and deleting media files to users.

In addition, the administrators can install "[YU Kaltura Media Assignment](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_kalmediaassign)", "[YU Kaltura Media Resource](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_kalmediares)", and "[YU Kaltura Media for Atto](https://moodle.org/plugins/atto_yukaltura)".
These plugins provide teachers ability of creating resource and activity modules which use kaltura media in their Moodle courses.
And, user can embed his/her media into text area (introduction or page content) through the Atto HTML editor.

Please note that there is a chance this module will not work on some Moodle environment.
Also, this package is only available in English and Japanese. Stay tuned to future versions for other language supports.

Original plugin package ("Kaltura Video Package") has better functions than ours and is easy to use. So that, for customers of the "Kaltura SaaS Edition", use the original plugin package is the better.
